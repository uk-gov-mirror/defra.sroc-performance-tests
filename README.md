# SROC Performance Tests

The Strategic Review of Charging (SROC) team have produced 2 apps

- [Tactical Charging Module (TCM)](https://github.com/DEFRA/sroc-tcm-admin) is an internal tool built by Defra to support the calculation of charges related to various permitting regimes
- [Charging Module API](https://github.com/DEFRA/charging-module-api) is essentially the same thing as the TCM, only it is API only and is still a work in progress

This project contains the current [JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/) test scripts for both.
